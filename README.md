<h1 align="center">Power⚡Pro Electrician Website Milestone 1</h1>

[Check out the live project here.](https://p-lundkvist.github.io/Electrician-website-milestone-project-1/)

This project is from an idea I got after talking to an old friend. He had just started an electrician company but had no website and no idea how to make one, hence why I did this project.

The website is created using the bootstrap framework, meaning it's responsive by default and it's mobile-first design, then working your way up to bigger devices.

The Power⚡Pro website is designed and formed so that customers looking to hire professional electricians quickly can find their way thru on the website.

                -   The main colors is black/white and yellow, every section also has a unique color touch.
            -   #### Typography
                -   The Roboto font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Roboto is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.
            -   #### Imagery
                -   Images is very important. The large, background hero image is designed to be simple but yet striking and catch the user's attention. It also has a old school, energetic feeling.
