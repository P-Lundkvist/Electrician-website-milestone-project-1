<h1 align="center">Power⚡Pro Electrician Website Milestone 1</h1>

[Check out the live project here.](https://p-lundkvist.github.io/Electrician-website-milestone-project-1/)

This project is from an idea I got after talking to an old friend. He had just started an electrician company but had no website and no idea how to make one, hence why I did this project.

The website is created using the bootstrap framework, meaning it's responsive by default and it's mobile-first design, then working your way up to bigger devices.

The Power⚡Pro website is designed and formed so that customers looking to hire professional electricians quickly can find their way thru on the website.
